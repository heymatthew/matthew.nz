    <h1>Code Review</h1>
    <p>Turn this into a post maybe?</p>
<p>Annika: Heyyyy just a random note (I almost wonder if I&rsquo;ve said it before :thinks: ) that I love the comments you leave on people&rsquo;s PRs. I&rsquo;m too busy to keep an eye on all of them, but I do usually try to get a sneak peak in when I see you&rsquo;ve commented on things. I am getting so much value out of following your thought processes! And without this being your intention I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and you&rsquo;ve had an impact on my growth as a dev :slightly_smiling_face: So THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Matty Gee: Aw, thank you Annika :slightly_smiling_face:. It&rsquo;s one of my areas of growth, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re finding them good :heart:
Annika: In that case, please use my comment as a confirmation that you&rsquo;re doing well here :slightly_smiling_face:
Matty Gee: The general structure I&rsquo;ve been following so far is based on conversations I&rsquo;ve had with Dan M. The 3 things I&rsquo;m trying to do are to contrast what I&rsquo;m looking at against some prior experience, then give some feedback with a symantic description. I used to use a lot of open ended feedback to try create discussion which was fine, but buried the lead a little bit.
Some advice adapted from Neil Gaiman:
Productivity: &ldquo;Write. Put one word in after another. Find the right word, put it down. Finish what you&rsquo;re writing. Whatever you have to do to finish it, finish it.&rdquo;
Code Review: &ldquo;Put it aside. Read it pretending you&rsquo;ve never read it before. Show it to friends whose opinion you respect&rdquo;
Review Feedback: &ldquo;When people tell you something&rsquo;s wrong or doesn&rsquo;t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong.&rdquo;
Refactoring: &ldquo;Fix it. Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving.&rdquo;

I go back to that from time to time and re-draw down on it&rsquo;s wisdom :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
