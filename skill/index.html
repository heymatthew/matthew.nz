    <h1>Understanding mixed skill levels</h1>
    <p>Beginners copy, experienced people follow principles, masters don&rsquo;t use rules at all. Masters scan the problem space to come up with novel solutions specific for the situation.</p>
<p>Pairing has always been tricky</p>
<p>Now that we have LLMs</p>

<p>If you pair up beginners they&rsquo;re both</p>
<p>Thinking about my own adaptability my knife skills are ok but when I&rsquo;m making a meal I often have to look up temperature, timings, and measurements. If I meet a chef or food scientist I might use my use stories to socialise, and thinking I have some good skill with the knife I may share my principles with a master. They become bored fast. Our skills do not match, the conversation moves on.</p>
<p>In the modern world we have to work with people at different experience levels even across disciplines. If you&rsquo;re working with someone at any skill level, be curious about their perspective. If you recognise you&rsquo;re dancing with someone who has more skill, let them lead the conversation more.</p>
<p>AI is like driving an autonomous vehicle. You can&rsquo;t take your eyes off the road, but when you need to take over it&rsquo;s at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>Super Car vs Model S, the former puts you in control but the latter you&rsquo;re babysitting.</p>
<p>Novice artists are excahnging tips on technique, masters excahnge tips on where to buy good terps.</p>
