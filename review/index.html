    <h1>Code Review</h1>
    <p>People who refactor are right, but if they make enormous pull requests they&rsquo;re bad their reviewers. People never signed up for your refactors, and you&rsquo;re hidinkg the changes you need to make.</p>
<p>People who focus on just the problem are right, but if they completely ignore the soft part of software they&rsquo;re killing their codebase.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the problem, you need to be both. That&rsquo;s where stacked changes help. Make the change easy then make the easy change, do it and make it clear by breaking out PRs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reorder your commits to push refactors to the bottom</li>
<li>Push 2 branches to separate rework vs the change</li>
<li>Use update-refs on rebase</li>
<li>Articulate to your reviewer how they&rsquo;re related</li>
<li>Describe tradeoffs inline</li>
</ul>
