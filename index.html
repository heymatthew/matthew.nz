    <h1>Hello</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m following with somewhat vague interest the various legal battles Apple is currently involved in. Reading their response to the EU&rsquo;s DMA makes me sad. Not for the company itself. I honestly could not care less about the company. Nor for the people who run that company. I&rsquo;m sad because the pursuit of endless growth is such a mind cancer. It consumes and distracts everyone. If you&rsquo;re an artisan, creating amazing objects is your end goal. Ideally, you want those objects to last forever. And if they don&rsquo;t, you want to do such an amazing job that once something is broken beyond repair, people will come to you again and ask you to make something new, rather than buying from someone else.</p>

<p>Apple makes amazing products. I bought the laptop I&rsquo;m typing this 9 years ago. It still works fine. Sure, it&rsquo;s slow compared to my new machine but I can use it to do calls and write blog posts. And that&rsquo;s great. I love it. I was happy to give Apple my money back in 2015. But you know who&rsquo;s not happy? Apple. Apple is not happy that I bought a laptop in 2015 that was so good that it is still working fine 9 years later. And it&rsquo;s also not happy that I bought a phone more than 4 years ago that still does all the things I need it to do. Because they need to make money. More money. There&rsquo;s no end state here. &ldquo;More&rdquo; has no end state. At some point, a company like Apple will inevitably run out of people willing to buy their stuff. Because it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect people to upgrade phones, laptops, screens, watches, tablets, virtual-ski-goggles every damn year. And so what do they do? They move into services. Music, movies, games, fitness, storage. You name it. But those also can&rsquo;t grow forever. Because guess what? There are other companies out there doing the same.</p>
