      <description>Jeff Bezos characterised decisions as &amp;ldquo;two-way&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;one-way&amp;rdquo; doors. A two way door means you can reverse a decision, but a one way door is difficult or expensive to reverse.&#xA;Framing things in this way is freeing because you can allow yourself to experiment knowing things can be undone. Detailed planning is just not required for easily reversable decisions.&#xA;Something I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to realise is that in my workplace some of these experimental decisions have the people around me feeling like they&amp;rsquo;re irreversable.</description>
