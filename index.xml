      <description>Goal: What do I want people to walk away feeling? That decisions about the structure of code are not permanent, that it&amp;rsquo;s healthy to experiment, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go into too much detail with structure unless our objects reflect the domain language lines up (see DDD).&#xA;Indirection only solves some problems, and always at the cost of dev ergonomics.&#xA;But it does solve problems. To be successful you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to get good at making bets on what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>
