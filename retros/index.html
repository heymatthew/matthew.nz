    <h1>Reflections on Retros</h1>
    <p>Without care the Scrum retrospective format becomes ineffective. Hallmarks include actions without owners, avoidance of difficult conversations, and productivity stagnation. If this is happening and you&rsquo;re able to take proactive steps to adjust the team environment then your role has changed.</p>
<p>Initially the retrospective format supports you, but as you grow you need to step up to take more responsibility to support the process. Teams where I had experienced people who lifted people up had great retrospectives. Pay it forward and support the process to lift others.</p>
<p>If your role changes your goal should be to listen, suggesting action, give gratitude, create safe spaces for dialogue, and take ownership for outcomes.</p>
