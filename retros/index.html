    <h1>Reflections on Retros</h1>
    <p>Without care the Scrum Retrospective format becomes ineffective. Hallmarks include actions without owners, avoidance of difficult conversations, and productivity stagnation.</p>
<p>I prefer to take proactive steps adjust the team environment. I do this by taking action and directly talking to stakeholders. That could mean engaging delivery managers, creating <a href="https://adr.github.io/">Architectural Decision Records</a>, or promoting best practice through pairing.</p>
<p>But lets not endorse the heliocentric model of meetings, those earlier in their careers appreciate structure to help support their growth. On reflection, teams where I had senior members who listened and lifted people up had great Retrospectives. You can&rsquo;t pay them back, so pay it forward. Step up and show care for the process by changing your perspective.</p>
<p>Make a difference by listening, suggesting actions, giving gratitude, creating safe spaces for dialogue, and taking ownership of outcomes.</p>
