    <h1>Reflections on Retros</h1>
    <p>I have a beef with Scrum Retrospectives when we create actions without owners, avoid difficult conversations, and don&rsquo;t see changes over time. The format does not get outcomes for me, but it seems true for those operating at Senior levels or above.</p>
<p>I prefer to take proactive steps adjust the team environment. I do this by taking action and directly talking to stakeholders. That could mean include engaging delivery managers, creating <a href="https://adr.github.io/">Architectural Decision Records</a> to align on a technical implementation, or promoting best practice through pairing.</p>
<p>But lets not endorse the heliocentric model of meetings, those earlier in their careers appreciate the structure as a way to affect change. A predictable format loans courage to share perspective that would otherwise hold back. Listen, suggest actions, take ownership of outcomes, and give gratitude.</p>
<p>I <em>had</em> a beef with Scrum Retrospectives, but now I see I needed to change how I engage with them. On reflection, teams where I had senior members who listened and lifted people up felt like better places. I can&rsquo;t pay them back, so I might as well pay it forward.</p>
