    <h1>Refactoring</h1>
    <p>Jeff Bezos characterised decisions as &ldquo;two-way&rdquo; or &ldquo;one-way&rdquo; doors. A two way door means you can reverse a decision, but a one way door is difficult or expensive to reverse.</p>
<p>Framing things in this way is freeing because you can allow yourself to experiment knowing things can be undone. Detailed planning is just not required for easily reversable decisions.</p>
<p>Something I&rsquo;ve grown to realise is that in my workplace some of these experimental decisions have the people around me feeling like they&rsquo;re irreversable.</p>
<p>This happens all the time. Kitset home has an original 70s kitchen and the owner is afraid to renovate. Asbestosis? A plumber can&rsquo;t upgrade the hot water cyllander without fixing ventilation causing the budget to blow out. Chorus just drilled aanother hole through the wall instead of re-running the cable.</p>
<p>Techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Holistic overview / systems thinking</li>
<li>Get robust at measuring and testing</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I want people to walk away feeling?</p>
<p>That decisions about the structure of code are not permanent, that it&rsquo;s healthy to experiment, we shouldn&rsquo;t go into too much detail with structure unless our objects reflect the domain language lines up (see DDD).</p>

<li>Fallacies— “Refactoring = Improving code&quot;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>improving is about understandability, your peers</li>
<li>it’s about structural change, not code</li>
</ul>
<p>Evolution is multiple competing ideas or things where the best wins. If you don’t have more than one example, it’s not evolution.</p>

<p>Use tech debt example
Use extending requirements
Use accidental load bearing example</p>
<p>Two ways remove bugs: make it so so simple you catch them all, or make it so complicated they can’t be found</p>
